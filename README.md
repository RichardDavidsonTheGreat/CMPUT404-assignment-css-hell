What I changed in part 1: I had to add the following line in the .html files to specify that they should be looking for additional style properties in cssfile.css link href

<link href="cssfile.css" rel="stylesheet">

In that file I made it so that any headers would have their color changed to a dark yellowish color (the darkest of the yellows I used for this part)
that their font would be italic and they would be of font Times New Roman. I also changed it so that paragraphs have a background-color that is a darkish yellow (the second darkest yellow I use in this part) I also made it so that their font is cursive. I also changed the background color to light yellow to make it more astetically pleasing.
Finally I added a solid gold (though it looks yellow) border to any images and made them more circular. I also formatted any captions (ie image captions) so that they will be in italics and of size 1em (m).
