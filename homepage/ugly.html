          <p>Hello my name is Richard Connor Davidson and I am in my fourth year of studies at the University of Alberta. I was born in 1998 and am currently 23 years old, living in Edmonton AB. I am originally from Winnipeg MB and I moved to Edmonton when I was 18 to attend the University of Alberta and study computing science. I love computers, both for play and for work and I am studying computing science. </p>
          <p>My primary areas of interest are artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity and web based application development. Ideally I would like to work for an institution that is focused on incorporating new technologies and practices and one which shares my views.</p>
          <p>In terms of my personal interests, I love going on bike rides, either alone or with friends. As well as going on daily strolls, especially with my father when I am in the same city as him. I also am a huge fan of dodgeball and basketball. Other than that, I also love spending time with friends and family and playing video games.</p>
          <p>In particular I am obsessed with the video game League of Legends. I've made many of the friends I hold closest to me in this game and I don't think I can count all the hours I have put into this game. Needless to say I am always down to talk about League of Legends. In case you were wondering the max rank I made it to was Platinum 3 all the way back in season 5.</p>

        <p class = "side-bar-title">My philosophy on work</p>
        <p class = "side-bar-text">I have always subscribed to the idea that anything worth doing is worth doing right. When I do something I will always do the best job that I can. Sometimes this means things take me a bit longer but in the end when I do something, I am always proud of the job I have done. </p>
        <p class = "side-bar-title">What sets me apart</p>
        <p class = "side-bar-text">On top of having done exceptionally well in my schooling I believe it is my numerous work placements which sets me apart from the competition. I have performed various different jobs for 3 different institutions for a combined full year of experience. During these times I have been quick to pick and master my newfound responsabilites and have received glowing reviews from both my mentors in these various placements as well as their boss’ or client’s for whom the systems I created were for.</p>
        <p class = "side-bar-title">What makes me special</p>
        <p class = "side-bar-text">When I was in grade 10 I was diagnosed with severe Chrone’s disease. This disease has lead to numerous weeks in the hospital and countless surgeries. I believe that this has given me a great deal of empathy and the ability to understand the actions of others as a complex interaction of forces.</p>
